- Better handling of session changes with proper state updates
- Automatic user profile creation if missing

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Improved error handling in all auth functions
- Better error messages and logging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing user profiles

### 4. **Loading States**
- Consistent loading states across all auth operations

## Testing

To test the authentication improvements:

1. **Sign Up Flow**:
   - Try creating a new account
   - Check console logs for detailed flow
   - Verify user profile is created automatically

2. **Sign In Flow**:
   - Try signing in with existing account
   - Check for proper loading states
   - Verify session persistence

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Check error messages are clear
   - Verify UI doesn't get stuck in loading state

4. **Session Management**:
   - Refresh the page while logged in
   - Check if session persists
   - Verify proper loading states during initialization

## Debug Information

The authentication system now provides detailed console logging:
- Session checks and changes
- User profile operations
- Error details
- Loading state changes

Use the debug page at `/debug-auth` to monitor authentication state in real-time.
